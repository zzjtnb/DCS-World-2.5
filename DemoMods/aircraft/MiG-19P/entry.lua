It was the first Soviet production aircraft capable of supersonic speeds in level flight. A comparable U.S. 'Century Series' fighter was the North American F-100 Super Sabre, although the MiG-19 would primarily oppose the more modern McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and Republic F-105 Thunderchief over North Vietnam."),
